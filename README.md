# ChatApp
Chat application using Golang as backend React TypeScript

## How to init and run
First clone project (git clone...)
Then, run 'npm install' to install all dependencies
Next, navigate to ./backend and run 'go run main.go' to start the server

Next, navigate to ./frontend and run 'npm start' to the frontend-client. 
This should open a tab in the preferred browser at localhost:3000. 
To run multiple clients at a time, simply open another tab and go to localhost:3000.

Happy chatting!
